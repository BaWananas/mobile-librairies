more specified table (like group-list), however it may be used without implementation.\nInstructions :\n\nFirst, create the required inputs for the components :\n\nOptions, \nColumns, \nAn event for refreshing the table\nThe data (Array of specified type).\n(Optional) Specify the function which will be called when an element was selected.\n\n\nAfter, add the html component in your template, and set the required inputs.\n\nFinally, add a @ViewChild() variable corresponding to the html component, and specify the data type.\n\n\nExample :\n\nimplementation.html
